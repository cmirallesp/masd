You can also try to look for information on any other site, 
using Google, Scholar Google or any other search engine. You 
can look for other examples of implemented agents, 
evaluations made by other people using that language, etc. 

Things you should analyze: 

A. Elements in the language/formalism 
eg: propositions, actions, events, tasks, plans .... 

B. Operational Semantics (how the language works) 

* Reasoning cycle (Deliberation, Means-end Reasoning... 
* Is there any Belief revision? 
* Is there any Goal/Intention revision? 
* Is there any Plan/Task revision? 
* Is there any special events' handling (i.e. emergency 
handling)? Is there any way to make agents react to sudden 
changes in the environment? 
* Is there any Meta-Level reasoning? (reasoning over the 
reasioning cycle). 

C. Formal Semantics (theoretical model) 

* Is there any theoretical model? 
* Which are their elements? (eg, propositions, actions, 
events, tasks, plans ....) Are those the same as in the 
implementation? 

D. Connecting with the environment: 

* Is there any agent platform? 
* Do messages follow FIPA specifications? 
* Which component manages the message passing between agents? 
* Can ontologies be included in messages? 

E. Tools 

* Are there any available tools? 

F. Execution examples 

* Download the software from the web and test it. 
* Search for examples about implemented agents (eg: the 
examples coming with the language) or, if you prefer, do 
your own tiny examples. 

G. (Optional) Connecting with other alternatives 

* If you find any information about the origins for the 
formalism/language, if you find comparisons already made 
with other alternatives, you can include them.

WEIGHT OF THIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT IN THE MARKS 
============================================ 

This work forms the 30% of the marks. 
Another 50% will be based on the practical 
(implementation) assignment, which will come after this 
first assignment 
The final 20% will be the final exam. 


FORMAT OF THIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT 
=============================== 

This work will have two parts 

* A 30-45 min presentation (if possible with slides) in 
which you explain the results of the analysis. I will not 
take into account the beauty of the slides, but that the 
content and the explanations you add are correct, understandable 
and didactic, and that you properly answer the questions 
made by others about your analysis. In groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 
it would be good if you can show us one example running on your computer. 

* a written document which summarizes the important 
parts of your analysis. 

Both things are taken into account for your first mark, but 
please put most of your effort in the presentation you will 
give to the rest of the class, so others can have some good 
understanding about what you have done.
